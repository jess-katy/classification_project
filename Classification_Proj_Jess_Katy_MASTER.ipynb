    "Why are our customers churning?\n",
    "Some questions I have include:\n",
    "*\tCould the month in which they signed up influence churn? i.e. if a cohort is identified by tenure, is there a cohort or cohorts who have a higher rate of churn than other cohorts? (Plot the rate of churn on a line chart where x is the tenure and y is the rate of churn (customers churned/total customers))\n",
    "*\tAre there features that indicate a higher propensity to churn? like type of internet service, type of phone service, online security and backup, senior citizens, paying more than x% of customers with the same services, etc.?\n",
    "*\tIs there a price threshold for specific services where the likelihood of churn increases once price for those services goes past that point? If so, what is that point for what service(s)?\n",
    "*\tIf we looked at churn rate for month-to-month customers after the 12th month and that of 1-year contract customers after the 12th month, are those rates comparable?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Deliverables:\n",
    "1.\tI will also need a report (ipynb) answering the question, \"Why are our customers churning?\" I want to see the analysis you did to answer my questions and lead to your findings. Please clearly call out the questions and answers you are analyzing. E.g. If you find that month-to-month customers churn more, I won't be surprised, but I am not getting rid of that plan. The fact that they churn is not because they can, it's because they can and they are motivated to do so. I want some insight into why they are motivated to do so. I realize you will not be able to do a full causal experiment, but I hope to see some solid evidence of your conclusions.\n",
    "2.\tI will need you to deliver to me a csv with the customer_id, probability of churn, and the prediction of churn (1=churn, 0=not_churn). I would also like a single goolgle slide that illustrates how your model works, including the features being used, so that I can deliver this to the SLT when they come with questions about how these values were derived. Please make sure you include how likely your model is to give a high probability of churn when churn doesn't occur, to give a low probability of churn when churn occurs, and to accurately predict churn.\n",
    "3.\tFinally, our development team will need a .py file that will take in a new dataset, (in the exact same form of the one you acquired from telco_churn.customers) and perform all the transformations necessary to run the model you have developed on this new dataset to provide probabilities and predictions.\n"
